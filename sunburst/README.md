# Sunburst Indicators

These lists are all observed hostnames for the DGA domain and any observed
IPV4 or IPV6 address. Because of the collection mechanism, this may include
redirected DNS queries (for instance from RPZ). This is being provided as-is
for research and hunt teams.

This data was generated from passive DNS by Open-Source Context: https://oscontext.com
